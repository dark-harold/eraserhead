## 📺 The Origin Story

In 2011, András István Arató — a retired Hungarian electrical engineer born July 11, 1945, in Kőszeg, Hungary — became an internet legend. His stock photography series on Dreamstime, shot by photographer **Nyul**, featured a silver-haired man with glasses performing everyday activities: computing, golfing, celebrating birthdays, seeing doctors.

The internet noticed something. Behind every staged smile, behind every stock-photo-perfect expression, there was *something else*. Pain. Existential dread. The quiet suffering of a man who has seen the codebase.

😐 The internet named him **Hide the Pain Harold**.

🌑 They were right. He was hiding something. He was hiding the same thing every developer hides: the knowledge that production is always one `git push` from disaster.

## 📏 Usage Guidelines

### Density Targets

| Document Type | Emoji Per 50 Lines | Target Personas |
|--------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| README | 3-5 | All, balanced |
| User Guide | 2-4 | 😐 ✅ 📺 primarily |
| API Reference | 1-3 | 😐 🌑 primarily |
| Security Docs | 4-6 | 🌑 ⚠️ primarily |
| Contributing | 3-5 | 😐 ✅ primarily |
| Architecture | 2-4 | 📺 🌑 primarily |
| Tutorials | 3-5 | 📺 ✅ 😐 primarily |

### Integration Patterns

**Section Headers** — Lead with persona emoji:
```markdown
## 🌑 Security Considerations

Dark Harold reminds us: every unencrypted byte is a confession.
```

**Callout Boxes** — Use emoji as severity indicators:
```markdown
> 😐 **Note**: This configuration is optional but Harold recommends it.

> 🌑 **Security Warning**: Failure to rotate keys is an invitation.

> ✅ **Best Practice**: Run the full test suite before every push.

> 📺 **Historical Context**: This protocol was inspired by...

> ⚠️ **Critical**: This vulnerability has a known exploit in the wild.
```

**Inline Commentary** — Sprinkle personality:
```markdown
The `rotate_keys()` function handles automatic key rotation. 😐 It works on the first try approximately 97% of the time, which is either reassuring or terrifying depending on your perspective.
```

**Code Comments** — Harold observes:
```python
# 😐 This definitely won't cause problems at scale
# 🌑 Assume the adversary has read this source code
# ✅ Tested with 10,000 concurrent sessions
# 📺 Fun fact: the original implementation used MD5
```

### Anti-Patterns

❌ **Don't**: Use emoji in every sentence (overwhelming)
❌ **Don't**: Use 🌑 for non-security contexts (dilutes meaning)
❌ **Don't**: Use ✅ for untested claims (Harold demands honesty)
❌ **Don't**: Mix Harold emoji with unrelated emoji (brand confusion)
❌ **Don't**: Force humor in critical security warnings (Dark Harold is serious)

✅ **Do**: Let the emoji enhance, not replace, technical content
✅ **Do**: Match persona to context (Dark Harold for security, Historian for explanations)
✅ **Do**: Use emoji at natural transition points (section headers, key warnings, conclusions)
