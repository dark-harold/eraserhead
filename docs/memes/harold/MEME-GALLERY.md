## The Origin Story

In 2011, András István Arató — a retired Hungarian electrical engineer born July 11, 1945, in Kőszeg, Hungary — became an internet legend. His stock photography series on Dreamstime, shot by photographer **Nyul**, featured a silver-haired man with glasses performing everyday activities: computing, golfing, celebrating birthdays, seeing doctors.

The internet noticed something. Behind every staged smile, behind every stock-photo-perfect expression, there was *something else*. Pain. Existential dread. The quiet suffering of a man who has seen the codebase.

The internet named him **Hide the Pain Harold**.
