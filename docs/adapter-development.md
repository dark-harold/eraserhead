# 😐 Adapter Development Guide

*How to teach EraserHead to delete things from new platforms. Every platform API is a unique snowflake of documentation pain.*

> 📺 **The Adapter Origin Story**: In the early days, every platform deletion was hand-coded. Then Harold realized there would be *many* platforms. And each one would have its own authentication dance, its own rate limits, its own creative interpretation of "DELETE." The Adapter Pattern was born from Harold's exhaustion.

---

## ✅ Overview

EraserHead uses the **Adapter Pattern** to support multiple platforms. Each adapter implements the `PlatformAdapter` abstract base class, handling platform-specific API interactions while the engine manages orchestration, retries, and verification.

> 😐 The engine handles the hard parts (queuing, retries, crash recovery). Your adapter handles the *painful* parts (platform APIs).

---

## 📺 Creating a New Adapter

> 📺 **Harold's Adapter Development Arc**: Step 1 — Read the platform's API docs. Step 2 — Realize they're incomplete. Step 3 — Reverse-engineer what "delete" actually does. Step 4 — Handle the 17 error codes they don't document. Step 5 — Ship it with a smile.

### Step 1: Subclass `PlatformAdapter`

)

            ResourceType.COMMENT,
            ResourceType.LIKE,
        }
```

### Step 2: Register with the Engine

```python
from eraserhead.engine import ScrubEngine, EngineConfig

engine = ScrubEngine(EngineConfig())
adapter = MyPlatformAdapter()
engine.register_adapter(adapter)
# ✅ Adapter registered. Harold nods approvingly.
```

### Step 3: Authenticate

```python
from eraserhead.models import PlatformCredentials, Platform

creds = PlatformCredentials(
    platform=Platform.TWITTER,
    username="harold",
    auth_token="your-bearer-token",
)
await adapter.authenticate(creds)
# 🌑 Credentials should come from the vault, not hardcoded. Harold is watching.
```

## 😐 Built-in Rate Limiting

> 😐 Rate limits exist because platforms don't want you deleting 10,000 posts per second. Harold respects this. Harold also finds it ironic that platforms make it hard to delete data they collected without asking.

The base class provides token bucket rate limiting. Configure per-platform:

```python
RateLimitConfig(
    requests_per_minute=30,   # Sustained rate
    burst_size=5,             # Allow short bursts
    cooldown_seconds=60.0,    # Cooldown after rate limit hit
)
```

When rate limited, `delete_resource()` returns a failed `DeletionResult` with "Rate limited" error. The engine's retry logic handles re-queuing with exponential backoff.

> ✅ **Best Practice**: Set conservative rate limits. A temporarily slow deletion is better than a permanently banned API key.

---

## 😐 Testing Your Adapter

> 📺 **Harold's Testing Philosophy**: Every platform API call should be mockable. Harold-tester generates edge cases. You implement the mocks.

```python
import pytest
from eraserhead.models import DeletionTask, Platform, ResourceType

class TestMyAdapter:
    """😐 Breaking platform adapters with a smile."""

    async def test_delete_success(self):
        """✅ The happy path — resource deleted successfully."""
        adapter = MyPlatformAdapter()
        adapter._api_client = MockAPIClient(success=True)
        adapter._status = AdapterStatus.AUTHENTICATED

        task = DeletionTask(
            platform=Platform.TWITTER,
            resource_type=ResourceType.POST,
            resource_id="test-123",
        )
        result = await adapter.delete_resource(task)
        assert result.success

    async def test_delete_not_found(self):
        """✅ 404 = already deleted. Harold considers this a win."""
        adapter = MyPlatformAdapter()
        adapter._api_client = MockAPIClient(raises=NotFoundError)
        adapter._status = AdapterStatus.AUTHENTICATED

        task = DeletionTask(...)
        result = await adapter.delete_resource(task)
        assert result.success  # 404 = already deleted

    async def test_delete_rate_limited(self):
        """😐 The platform pushed back. Harold waits patiently."""
        adapter = MyPlatformAdapter()
        adapter._api_client = MockAPIClient(raises=RateLimitError)
        adapter._status = AdapterStatus.AUTHENTICATED

        task = DeletionTask(...)
        result = await adapter.delete_resource(task)
        assert not result.success
        # 🌑 The engine will retry with backoff
```

---

## 📺 Adapter Statistics

The base class tracks operational stats automatically:

```python
stats = adapter.stats
print(f"Total requests: {stats.total_requests}")
print(f"Success rate: {stats.success_rate:.1%}")
print(f"Rate limit hits: {stats.rate_limit_hits}")
# 😐 If success_rate < 90%, something is wrong with the platform. Or with your adapter.
# 🌑 Harold recommends investigating before the rate_limit_hits pile up.
```

---

## ✅ Best Practices

> 📺 Harold has built adapters for five platforms. Here's what he learned, condensed into wisdom earned through suffering.

1. **✅ Handle 404 as success**: If a resource is already deleted, return `success=True`. Don't retry the already-gone.
2. **✅ Include proof**: Store API response codes or deletion confirmation IDs. 🌑 You may need evidence later.
3. **😐 Respect rate limits**: Set conservative `RateLimitConfig` values. Better slow than banned.
4. **🌑 Test error paths**: Rate limits, network errors, auth failures, unexpected JSON responses, the platform changing their API without notice on a Friday afternoon.
5. **✅ Clean disconnection**: Release API connections in `_do_disconnect()`. Leaked connections are Harold's least favorite kind of leak (after credential leaks).
6. **😐 Metadata support**: Use `task.metadata` for platform-specific parameters that don't fit the standard model.

---

*😐 Every platform API is a unique snowflake of documentation pain. Adapters absorb this suffering so the engine doesn't have to.*

🌑 *Harold has been through five platform APIs. Harold has the scars. Harold documented them so you don't have to earn your own.*
